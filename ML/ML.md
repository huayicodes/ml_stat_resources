# General Resources

## Courses

- [*CIS 520: Machine Learning*](https://www.shivani-agarwal.net/Teaching/CIS-520/Spring-2018/index.html), UPenn

   This course provides a thorough modern introduction to the field of machine learning. It is designed for students who want to understand not only what machine learning algorithms do and how they can be used, but also the fundamental principles behind how and why they work. See the course description for more details.

- [Statistical Learning](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/sohs-ystatslearning-statistical-learning), Trevor Hastie
& Robert Tibshirani

   This is an introductory-level course in supervised learning, with a focus on regression and classification methods. The syllabus includes: linear and polynomial regression, logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis; cross-validation and the bootstrap, model selection and regularization methods (ridge and lasso); nonlinear models, splines and generalized additive models; tree-based methods, random forests and boosting; support-vector machines. Some unsupervised learning methods are discussed: principal components and clustering (k-means and hierarchical). (Note: the video lectures are accessible without signing up [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/in-depth-introduction-to-machine-learning-in-15-hours-of-expert-videos/amp/))

- [CS229: Machine Learning](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html), Moses Charikar, Tengyu Ma, Christopher Ré

- [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), Andrew Ng

   This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, data-mining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.

## Books

- [*Data Science From Scratch*](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python/dp/1492041130/ref=dp_ob_title_bk), Joel Grus
   A nice, easy to read reference of a wide range of ML/DS problems. Simple a good place to start.
