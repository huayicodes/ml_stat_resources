## Introductions to Neural Networks

- [But what is a Neural Network? Deep learning, chapter 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk)

   Great video series on neural nets by YouTuber 3Blue1Brown.

- [Fully Connected Deep Networks](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/tensorflow-for-deep/9781491980446/ch04.html)

   Freely available preview chapter from [*Tensorflow for Deep Learning*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/tensorflow-for-deep/9781491980446/). A nice introduction to fully connected deep networks with some brief mathematical theory.


## Getting Started

- [Official PyTorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)

   Comprehensive and readable with examples and some of the math, showing how to solve common ML problems with PyTorch. Start with the [Sixty-Minute Blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) a 1-hour tutorial that explains PyTorch at a high level and how to train a neural net to classify images.

- [Keras Documentation](https://keras.io/#you-have-just-found-keras)

   A competing high-level API to build NN in Python. My feeling is PyTorch's online documentation is maybe a little better, but the book [*Deep Learning With Python*](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-with-Python/dp/B07H5RKKB6/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=Deep+Learning+with+Python&qid=1586443803&s=books&sr=1-3) uses Keras and it is a really good book.

## Best practices

- [Don't use sigmoid: Neural Nets](https://kharshit.github.io/blog/2018/04/20/don%27t-use-sigmoid-neural-nets)

   I guess everyone should ReLU and tweak the learning rates. If you want to know why read above.
