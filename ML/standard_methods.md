## Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier

- [Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier: Iris data set](https://xavierbourretsicotte.github.io/Naive_Bayes_Classifier.html)

   Nice write-up of applying the sklearn Naive_Bayes_Classifier to the Iris dataset.

## Linear Methods

- [PyData talk: Winning with Simple, even Linear, Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68ABAU_V8qI)

   Great talk about how to get a lot of mileage with tricks using logistic and linear regression.

## Encoding Data for ML Models

- [Smarter Ways to Encode Categorical Data for Machine Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/smarter-ways-to-encode-categorical-data-for-machine-learning-part-1-of-3-6dca2f71b159)

    Better encoding of categorical data can mean better model performance. In this article Iâ€™ll introduce you to a wide range of encoding options from the [Category Encoders](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/index.html) package for use with scikit-learn machine learning in Python.


### Logistic regression
