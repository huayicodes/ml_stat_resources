   This course provides an elementary introduction to probability and statistics with applications. Topics include: basic combinatorics, random variables, probability distributions, Bayesian inference, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and linear regression.



## Books covering general topics

- [*Statistical Inference*](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Inference-George-Casella/dp/0534243126), Casella and Berger

   A good introduction to graduate level statistics.

- [*Elements of Statistical Learning*](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Inference-George-Casella/dp/0534243126), Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman

   The textbook showing the rigorous math behind many ML techniques. Available as a free PDF.

- [*Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers*](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers), Cam Davidson-Pilon

   A great introduction to Probabilistic programming and bayesian methods, e.g. Monte Carlo, MCMC, etc. lots of examples using PyMC3. Free on github.

## Probability Distributions

- [Common Probability Distributions: The Data Scientist’s Crib Sheet](https://medium.com/@srowen/common-probability-distributions-347e6b945ce4)

   Data scientists have hundreds of probability distributions from which to choose. Where to start? Includes descriptions of the following distributions: Bernoulli and Uniform, Binomial and Hypergeometric, Poisson, Geometric and Negative Binomial, Exponential and Weibull, Normal, Log-Normal, Student’s t, and Chi-squared, Gamma and Beta.
