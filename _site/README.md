# Main Page 

A list of books, blog articles, lectures, online course, and easy to read papers
organized by topic. Useful for self-learning. Largely a place for me to keep
track of all the places to start with new projects.

Shamelessly compiled and organized from recommended by 2020A NY Insight Data
Science fellows. Inspired by [these](https://github.com/boada/data-science-interviews) [repos](https://github.com/eric-epstein-5747/data-science-interviews)

Tried to make it searchable so it is easy to find what you want. Feel free to add.
